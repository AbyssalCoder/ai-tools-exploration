## GitHub Actions — CI/CD

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: python -m pytest
```

Workflows live in `.github/workflows/` and trigger on events.

## Docker Volumes

Volumes persist data beyond container lifecycle.

```bash
# Named volume
docker volume create mydata
docker run -v mydata:/app/data nginx

# Bind mount (host directory)
docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data nginx

# List volumes
docker volume ls

# Inspect
docker volume inspect mydata
```

Prefer named volumes over bind mounts in production.
