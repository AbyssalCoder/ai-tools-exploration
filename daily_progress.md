## Star Pattern — Right Triangle

```python
n = 5
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    print('* ' * i)
```

Output:
```
* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * * 
```

## Palindrome — Two-pointer Approach

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

Runs in O(n/2) comparisons with O(1) extra space.

Went through Pattern Printing concepts and examples.

Connecting this to what I learned last week about related concepts.

## Count vowels and consonants

```python
def count_vc(s):
    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')
    v = c = 0
    for ch in s:
        if ch.isalpha():
            if ch in vowels:
                v += 1
            else:
                c += 1
    return v, c

print(count_vc('Hello World'))  # (3, 7)
```

Revisited CI/CD Basics and took better notes.

Found a good resource that explained this clearly.

## Factorial

```python
# Iterative
def factorial_iter(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Recursive
def factorial_rec(n):
    return 1 if n <= 1 else n * factorial_rec(n - 1)

print(factorial_iter(5))  # 120
```
